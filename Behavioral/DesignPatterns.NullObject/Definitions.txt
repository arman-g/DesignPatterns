== Null Object Pattern ==

 @ Intent

- Rid program logic of null checks where posible
- Provide a non-functional object in place of a null reference
- Allow methods to be called on Null objects, unlike a null reference

@ Applicability

- When handling of null should be abstracted from the client
- When an object requires a collaborator
- Examples:
-- Implementing a Null Strategy object when we don't want work to actually be done by the strategy executor
-- Implementing a Nul Command object when we want the command executor to do nothing
