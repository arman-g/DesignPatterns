== Simple Factory Pattern ==

 @ Intent (General Factory Patterns)

-- Separate object creation from the decision of which object to create

- Add new classes and functionality without breaking OCP
-- Factory-produced objects
-- Factories themselves (for abstruct factory)

- Store which object to create outside of the program
-- In a database
-- In configuration


@ Intent (Simple Factory)

-- Encapsulate object creation

- Allows for late-bound decisions regarding instantiation
-- Configuration-based
-- Other persistent storage
-- Input or other dynamic data

- Caller class knows what concrete factory it needs
