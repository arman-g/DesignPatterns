== Abstract Factory Pattern ==

 @ Intent (General Factory Patterns)

-- Separate object creation from the decision of which object to create

- Add new classes and functionality without breaking OCP
-- Factory-produced objects
-- Factories themselves (for abstruct factory)

- Store which object to create outside of the program
-- In a database
-- In configuration


@ Intent (Abstract Factory)

- All the attributes of Factory Method
- Concrete factory classes may return varous objects from a "family" of objects
