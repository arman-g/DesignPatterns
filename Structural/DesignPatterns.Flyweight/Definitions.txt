== Flyweight Pattern ==

 @ Intent

- Reduce storage costs for large number of objects
- Share objects to be used in multiple contexts simultaneously
- Retain objects oriented granularity and flexibility

@ Consequences

- Group of objects are replaced by a few shared objects once extrinsic state is removed
- Storage savings are derived from
   * Reduced instances
   * Amount of intrinsic state per object
   * Whether extinsic state is computed or stored
- Application can no longer depend on object's identity
